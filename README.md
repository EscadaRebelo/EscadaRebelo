**`Front-End / Mobile Developer`**

Computer Science and Engineering graduate, currently seeking for a place to apply and further enhance my knowledge and skills.
Always had the will and desire of being able to develop my own apps and creating different projects, so i decided to go to university in order to learn more about the area and follow that passion.
Throughout that time, I've learned to work with several programming languages and many different software development tools, that gave me the skills required to follow a career in this area.
I've developed a stronger taste for Front-End and mobile development, and so, i decided to further increase my knowledge and capabilities in this topic by self-teaching and by completing a few online courses in this area.
Since then i've been developing my own Web & mobile apps and working on a few personal projects that will come out in a foreseeable future.

 <summary><h3>⚒️ Further info & Future Projects</h3></summary>
   During my time in university I had the experience of working with colleagues in varied projects(including my final graduation project) at the Assisted Living Computing and Telecommunications Laboratory - ALLab, 
   which gave me the oppurtunity of learning a lot about different fields on IT and its research areas.
While working with them, I developed a project called "Monitoring platform and irrigation control for precision agriculture" (find the project on my website).
 In the future i'm planning on adding a bunch of new features and extending functionalities to a house environment.
Where users will be able to control their garden watering, home temperature, home security and lightning, all throw a mobile app.
 <p>
  Currently I'm developing a basketball app for coaches, where they can register players physical data, game statistics, individual and collective practice drills, practice attendance sheet, and a bunch of other features. Players will also have access to the app, to stay in track of their data and to receive updates from the coaching staff. Ultimately this app has the purpose to facilitate the work of the coaching team and to motivate athletes by showing them their progression over time.
